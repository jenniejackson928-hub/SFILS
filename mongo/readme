This was a much easier assignment than assignment 1. MongoDB was a whole lot more user-friendly compared to MySQL, and my import took a matter of seconds instead of days. Although I still have some questions on how both MySQL and MongoDB work, I had an easier time learning MongoDB. I did struggle with getting the database and python to connect.
